            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate computer science enthusiast with a deep commitment to exploring its many facets. At 18 years old in 2025, I have immersed myself in a variety of computer science fields—from competitive programming to AI research. Since 2019, I have competed in coding competitions, including representing Malaysia on the international stage at events like the International Olympiad in Informatics. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also become a core part of my identity as a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I serve as a problem setter and active member of the Malaysian Informatics and Programming Society (MIPS), an organization responsible for selecting and mentoring top-tier participants for national coding competitions. My competitive journey and collaborative work with MIPS have solidified my commitment to excellence in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to programming competitions, my interests extend to artificial intelligence and deep learning. I have co-authored IEEE papers on deep learning and machine learning applications related to electroencephalography signals, which have allowed me to further develop my research skills and contribute to cutting-edge advancements in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I am eager to learn from both educators and peers as I continue my academic journey. I firmly believe that computer science is a driving force for the future, and I am dedicated to playing a role in developing innovative projects and products that will shape our world.
